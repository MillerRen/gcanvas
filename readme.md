Gcanvas
========
An HTML5 Canvas API implementation that generates Gcode for CNC milling. Runs in node and the browser. 

http://emery.denucc.io/gcanvas/examples

```
var ctx = new GCanvas();
ctx.depth = 1;
ctx.depthOfCut = 0.25; // 4 passes
ctx.strokeText("Robots are cool", "20pt");
```

### Non-standard extensions to Canvas 

Additional context properties are added for milling
and to support stroke-alignment which the canvas spec doesn't have yet (but really needs).

* `context.depth` Specifies the total Z depth to cut into the work. If not set the Z axis never changes. 

* `context.depthOfCut` Specifies an incrementing depth of cut in layers up to `context.depth`.

* `context.surface` The Z offset of the work surface. Use with depthOfCut otherwise you'll make make several passes before cutting anything. Defaults to 0.
 
* `context.toolDiameter` This must be set for fill() to work properly because it has to calculate tool offsets.

* `context.feed` Sets the feedrate by sending a single F command.

* `context.speed` Sets the spindle speed by sending a single S command.

* `context.coolant` Can be true, false, "mist" (M07) or "flood" (M08). True defaults to "flood".

* `context.strokeAlign` can be 'inset', 'outset', or 'center' (default)

In the future I plan to determine most of these automatically with two properties, `context.material` and `context.tool`. But they should always be overridable and it makes sense to get the basics right first.

### Unit conversion
GCanvas doesn't have any built-in understanding of units,
because `scale()` works perfectly for this, and is compatible
with a normal canvas.

I usually mill in mm's which means if I do a `lineTo(10,0)`,
on my CNC machine that is 10mm on the X axis, but in a browser
canvas that's 10px. That isn't always so bad but if I am working
on something really detailed I usually `scale(10,10)` the preview only,
independent of the actual drawing making 1mm = 10px.

To work in inches I `scale(25.4, 25.4)` rather than bothering to issue a G20 to the driver.
  
### Defining stock material
Draw it and use `clip()`! It works perfectly.


### Command line utility
GCanvas comes with a command line utility that you can use to write
machining tasks as simple standalone .js files. Just define a main(context) function in the script, and gcanvas will pass it a
pre-built context that outputs to stdout.

```
// helloworld.js
function main(ctx) {
  ctx.strokeText("Hello World");
}
```
```
$ gcanvas helloworld.js | serialportterm -baud 9600 /dev/tty.usbmodem1337
```

### Why

1. The most common machining tasks are 2.5D.
2. Easily run drawing code against a real canvas for previewing.
3. A good basis for implementing more specific Javascript milling tools. e.g. svg, pcbs
